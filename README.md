Implmentation of the design patterns from the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns) in C#


I started reading design patterns in june and discovered a nice [blog](https://exceptionnotfound.net/). i really enjoyed reading his simple and clean and intuitive illustrations, which mainly use food. i thought it would be nice exercise for myself to practice those design patterns on some different but still simple concepts and procedures in daily life.
