I started reading Design Patterns in June and discovered a nice [blog](https://exceptionnotfound.net/). I really enjoyed reading his simple and clean and intuitive illustrations, which mainly use food. I thought it would be nice exercise for myself to practice those design patterns on some different but still simple concepts and procedures in daily life.
