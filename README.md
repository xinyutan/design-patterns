I started reading Design Patterns in June and discovered a nice [blog](https://exceptionnotfound.net/). I really enjoyed reading his simple and clean and intuitive illustrations, which mainly use food. I thought it would be nice exercise for myself to practice those design patterns on some different but still simple concepts and procedures in daily life. 

### Builder

For this highly artificial example, I don't see the need to use Builder pattern. It would be much easier to have just one builder class, which takes in different products.
